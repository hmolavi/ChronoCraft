## ✍️ Introduction ✍️
ChronoCraft is an innovative timeline creation software that revolutionizes the way we visualize and analyze chronological data. Our team is dedicated to providing a user-friendly tool that empowers users to effortlessly generate timelines for any search result. With ChronoCraft, you can transform raw data into captivating stories, uncovering valuable insights and patterns along the way. Whether you're a researcher, historian, or simply curious about the passage of time, ChronoCraft is the ultimate companion for crafting data into compelling narratives.

## 💡 Inspiration 💡

The resource that became our core inspiration was the ["Timeline of Poets & Scientists" infographic Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C636c9PgOZM) designed by [Mohammad Rasoulipour](https://www.instagram.com/mo.rasoulipour/), which Amin spotted and shared with the group. This inspired us to work on a history vizualization project, where at a higher level, ChronoCraft attempts to do the challenge of identifying, analyzing, and illustrating chronological data. We were intrigued by the limitations of existing timeline creation tools—even certain Wikipedia pages that aimed to offer timelines—due to often lacking user-friendly interfaces and automation capabilities. To address these shortcomings, we developed a software that not only generates timelines based on the provided dataset, but also enables customization and annotation of them. By simplifying the process of creating timelines, our goal is to unlock valuable insights and patterns hidden within the passage of time, as an accessible educational tool.
## ⚙️ What It Does ⚙️
Our main objectives for ChronoCraft are:
- Develop an intuitive and interactive user interface for creating and customizing timelines.
- Implement algorithms to automatically generate timelines based on the provided dataset.
- Enable users to add events, milestones, and annotations to the generated timelines.
- Provide options for customizing the appearance and layout of the timelines.

## 🛠️ How We Built It 🛠️
To achieve our objectives, we will follow these steps:
1. Research and analyze existing timeline creation tools and libraries.
2. Design and develop the core functionality of ChronoCraft, including data parsing, timeline generation, and user interface components.
3. Implement algorithms to handle different types of chronological data, such as dates, durations, and intervals.
4. Test and refine the software to ensure accuracy and usability with Sauce Labs.
5. Document the development process and provide clear instructions for users.

## ⚠️ Challenges we ran into ⚠️
- Learning Neorelo was an interesting and exciting journey. We had to familiarize ourselves with the Neorelo Schema Editor, understand its documentation, and overcome unfamiliar erros. It required time and effort to become proficient in using Neorelo effectively for our project. However, the learning process was rewarding as it expanded our knowledge and skills in working with this new awesome tool.


## ⏭️ Future Plans for ChronoCraft ⏭️
While our initial focus is on creating a functional prototype for the hackathon, we have ambitious plans for the future of ChronoCraft. Some of our future plans include:
- Scaling the application to a larger user base and integrating with platforms like Wikipedia, allowing for the chronological ordering of information.
- Partnership with Adobe Express; enhancing the software with advanced visualization options such as interactive charts and graphs.
- Integrating with external data sources to automatically populate timelines with relevant information.
- Adding collaboration features to allow multiple users to work on the same timeline simultaneously.
- Expanding the software to support different languages and localization.
