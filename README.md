## ‚òùÔ∏è What is ChronoCraft ‚òùÔ∏è

ChronoCraft is an innovative timeline creation software that revolutionizes the way we visualize and analyze chronological data. Our team is dedicated to providing a user-friendly tool that empowers users to effortlessly generate timelines for any search result. With ChronoCraft, you can transform raw data into captivating stories, uncovering valuable insights and patterns along the way. Whether you're a researcher, historian, or simply curious about the passage of time, ChronoCraft is the ultimate companion for crafting data into compelling narratives.

## üí° Inspiration üí°

The resource that became our core inspiration was the ["Timeline of Poets & Scientists" infographic Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C636c9PgOZM) designed by [Mohammad Rasoulipour](https://www.instagram.com/mo.rasoulipour/), which Amin spotted and shared with the group. This inspired us to work on a history vizualization project, where at a higher level, ChronoCraft attempts to do the challenge of identifying, analyzing, and illustrating chronological data. We were intrigued by the limitations of existing timeline creation tools‚Äîeven certain Wikipedia pages that aimed to offer timelines‚Äîdue to often lacking user-friendly interfaces and automation capabilities. To address these shortcomings, we developed a software that not only generates timelines based on the provided dataset, but also enables customization and annotation of them. By simplifying the process of creating timelines, our goal is to unlock valuable insights and patterns hidden within the passage of time, as an accessible educational tool.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What It Does ‚öôÔ∏è

Upon entering the app, you are greeted with an intuitive timeline research tool designed to empower users with advanced analytical capabilities. This tool allows users to visualize any information that involves a time flow. For instance, venture capital financial flows for investors, historical events for students, and company research for business professionals.

We utilize AI to summarize and filter information effortlessly. Additionally, thanks to Neurelo's flexible database maintenance, we have implemented a high-quality information database. Users don't need to create complex filters or search on Google. Simply type in natural language, and we handle the rest, providing seamless visualization. Furthermore, we are planning to implement an image generator based on search results for an even richer experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It üõ†Ô∏è

For the frontend, ReactJS and NextJS were chosen for their powerful and flexible JavaScript frameworks. ReactJS provides a component-based architecture while NextJS, on the other hand, offers server-side rendering and routing capabilities, enhancing the performance and user experience of the application.

On the backend, we utilized Neurelo, a powerful tool for managing and deploying serverless functions. Neurelo allowed us to easily handle backend logic and integrate with external APIs. We also leveraged MongoDB Atlas, a fully managed cloud database service, to store and retrieve data efficiently.

By combining these technologies, we were able to create a robust and scalable application that delivers a seamless user experience while effectively handling data management and processing.

## üèÜ Accomplishments That We're Proud Of üèÜ

- Learning Neorelo was an interesting and exciting journey. We had to familiarize ourselves with the Neorelo Schema Editor, understand its documentation, and overcome unfamiliar erros. It required time and effort to become proficient in using Neorelo effectively for our project. However, the learning process was rewarding as it expanded our knowledge and skills in working with this new awesome tool.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges we ran into ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Nerelo and MongoDB learning curves.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Future Plans for ChronoCraft ‚è≠Ô∏è

While our initial focus is on creating a functional prototype for the hackathon, we have ambitious plans for the future of ChronoCraft. Some of our future plans include:

- Scaling the application to a larger user base and integrating with platforms like Wikipedia, allowing for the chronological ordering of information.
- Partnership with Adobe Express; enhancing the software with advanced visualization options such as interactive charts and graphs.
- Integrating with external data sources to automatically populate timelines with relevant information.
- Adding collaboration features to allow multiple users to work on the same timeline simultaneously.
- Expanding the software to support different languages and localization.
- Creating a many to many correlation for future optomization
